/// Wraps a NIO ``Channel`` object into a form suitable for use in Swift Concurrency.
///
/// ``NIOAsyncChannel`` abstracts the notion of a NIO ``Channel`` into something that
/// can safely be used in a structured concurrency context. In particular, this exposes
/// the following functionality:
///
/// - reads are presented as an `AsyncSequence`
/// - writes can be written to with async functions, providing backpressure
/// - channels can be closed seamlessly
///
/// This type does not replace the full complexity of NIO's ``Channel``. In particular, it
/// does not expose the following functionality:
///
/// - user events
/// - traditional NIO backpressure such as writability signals and the ``Channel/read()`` call
///
/// Users are encouraged to separate their ``ChannelHandler``s into those that implement
/// protocol-specific logic (such as parsers and encoders) and those that implement business
/// logic. Protocol-specific logic should be implemented as a ``ChannelHandler``, while business
/// logic should use ``NIOAsyncChannel`` to consume and produce data to the network.
public final class NIOAsyncChannel<InboundIn, OutboundOut>: Sendable {
    /// The underlying channel being wrapped by this ``NIOAsyncChannel``.
